This category includes individuals with known admixture of primarily European, African and Native American ancestries, though some may have also a degree of Asian (e.g. Peru). We also note that the levels of admixture vary depending on the country, with Caribbean countries carrying higher levels of African admixture when compared to South American countries, for example. This category also includes individuals who genetically cluster with reference populations from this region, for example 1000 Genomes and/or HapMap CLM, MXL, PEL and PUR populations		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HANCESTRO_0014	false
HANCESTRO_0015	Greater Middle Eastern  (Middle Eastern, North African or Persian)	Includes individuals who self-report or were described by authors as Middle Eastern, North African, Persian or one of the subpopulations from this region (e.g. Saudi Arabian). We note there is heterogeneity in this category with different degrees of admixture as well as levels of genetic isolation. We note that there does not appear to be a suitable reference population for this category and efforts are required to fill this gap.

HANCESTRO_0016	African American or Afro-Caribbean	Includes individuals who either self-report or have been described by authors as African American or Afro-Caribbean. This category also includes individuals who genetically cluster with reference populations from this region, for example 1000 Genomes and/or HapMap ACB or ASW populations. We note that there is likely to be significant admixture with European ancestry populations.		http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HANCESTRO_0016	false
HANCESTRO_0017	Oceanian	Includes individuals that either self-report or have been described by authors as Oceanian or one of the sub-populations from this region (e.g. Native Hawaiian).

EFO_0006798	neuritic plaque measurement	quantification of  neuritic (senile) plaques in the brain, Senile plaques (also known as neuritic plaques, senile druse and braindruse) are extracellular deposits of amyloid beta in the grey matter of the brain.[1][2] Degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes can be associated with senile plaque deposits. These deposits can also be a byproduct of senescence (ageing). However, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles.[3] The plaques are variable in shape and size, but are on average 50 µm in size.[4] In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides.	senile plaque measurement	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0006798	false
