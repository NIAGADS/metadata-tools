      description: The Phenoscape project is both a major driver of and contributor to Uberon, contibuting thousands of terms. The teleost (bony fishes) component of Uberon was derived from the Teleost Anatomy Ontology, developed by the Phenoscape group. Most of the high level design of the skeletal system comes from the Vertebrate Skeletal Anatomy Ontology (VSAO), also created by the Phenoscape group. Phenoscape curators continue to extend the ontology, covering a wide variety of tetrapod structures, with an emphasis on the appendicular system.

  description: STATO is a general-purpose STATistics Ontology. Its aim is to provide coverage for processes such as statistical tests, their conditions of application, and information needed or resulting from statistical methods, such as probability distributions, variables, spread and variation metrics. STATO also covers aspects of experimental design and description of plots and graphical representations commonly used to provide visual cues of data distribution or layout and to assist review of the results.
